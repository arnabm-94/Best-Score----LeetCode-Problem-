# Best-Score--LeetCode-Problem-
Given a list, write a function to get first, second best scores from the list.  List may contain duplicates.

'''
#Time complexity:

The function iterates through the list my_list once, with each iteration taking constant time O(1) to perform comparisons and updates. 
Since there are n elements in the list, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

#Space complexity:

The function uses a constant amount of additional space to store the variables max1 and max2. 
There are no other data structures or variables created that depend on the size of the input list. 
Therefore, the space complexity is O(1), as it remains constant regardless of the input size.
